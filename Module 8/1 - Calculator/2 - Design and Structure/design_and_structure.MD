## Module 8: Section 1.2 - Design and Structure of a CLI Calculator

---

### 1. Introduction

When building a software application, particularly a CLI (Command-Line Interface) tool, understanding the design and structural components is paramount. This section will explore the design decisions, structural components, and architectural considerations for our CLI-based calculator project.

### 2. Design Principles

#### 2.1 Simplicity

- Our primary goal is to keep the user experience and backend operations straightforward. Over-complication can lead to increased development time and potential bugs.

#### 2.2 Scalability

- While starting with basic features, the design should accommodate the addition of future features or extensions without a complete overhaul.

#### 2.3 Modularity

- Breaking down the calculator into distinct modules or components allows for easier testing, maintenance, and understanding of the codebase.

### 3. Components & Layout

#### 3.1 Main Driver (Entry Point)

- The initial point of interaction for the user. It's responsible for capturing user input and displaying results or errors.

#### 3.2 Arithmetic Module

- Houses the logic for mathematical operations.
- Ensures the separation of concerns, i.e., calculation logic is isolated from user input/output.

#### 3.3 History Module

- Manages the storage and retrieval of previous calculations.
- Enables the user to review past operations.

#### 3.4 Error Handling Module

- Dedicated to handling any errors or exceptions that might arise, ensuring the user receives understandable error messages.

### 4. Architecture

The calculator will follow a linear and synchronous architecture, but with modular components:

1. **Capture User Input:** The main driver fetches the user's command.
2. **Parse & Delegate:** It then parses this input to understand the desired operation and delegates the actual calculation to the Arithmetic Module.
3. **Calculate:** The Arithmetic Module performs the computation and returns the result.
4. **Display & Store:** The Main Driver displays the result and simultaneously stores it in the History Module.
5. **Error Handling:** At each stage, potential errors are checked and managed by the Error Handling Module.

### 5. Interface Design

While the CLI is text-based, its design can significantly impact the user experience:

#### 5.1 Clear Prompts

- Users should be provided with clear instructions on input formats and available commands.

#### 5.2 Responsive Feedback

- Immediate feedback on successful operations, errors, or system messages.

#### 5.3 History Access

- Commands for users to retrieve and clear their operation history.

---

### 6. Important Design Decisions

#### 6.1 In-memory vs. Persistent History Storage

- Given the scope, **in-memory storage** is chosen for history. It's faster and avoids external dependencies. However, history will not persist across sessions.

#### 6.2 Error Handling Strategy

- Instead of crashing or displaying raw error messages, user-friendly error messages will guide the user to rectify their inputs.

### 7. Tips for New Developers

1. **Plan Before Coding:** Outline the primary components and flow of your application before diving into coding.
2. **Documentation:** Comment your code extensively. It aids future-you and other developers.
3. **Consistent Naming Conventions:** Choose a naming convention for variables, functions, and modules, and stick to it.
4. **Iterative Development:** Build and test in small chunks. This way, identifying issues becomes easier.
5. **Stay Updated:** The tech world evolves rapidly. Keep an eye on updates to languages or libraries you're using.

### 8. Conclusion

Designing and structuring a CLI application like our calculator requires careful planning and a clear understanding of core principles like modularity and scalability. This foundational work ensures smoother development and a more robust final product.
