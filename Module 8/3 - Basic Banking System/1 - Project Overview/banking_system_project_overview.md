## 2. Project Features

### 2.1 Account Management

- **Account Creation:** Allow users to open new bank accounts with initial deposit amounts.
  
- **Account Closure:** Facilitate the closure of existing accounts, ensuring all dues are cleared.

### 2.2 Transactions

- **Deposits:** Accept deposit amounts into bank accounts.

- **Withdrawals:** Allow withdrawals, ensuring sufficient funds in the account.

### 2.3 Account Balance

- **Check Balance:** Enable users to view their current account balance.

### 2.4 Transaction History

- **View History:** Let users view their past transactions, including dates, amounts, and transaction types.

## 3. Objectives

### 3.1 Simplicity

- Prioritize a clean and user-friendly CLI experience, ensuring even those unfamiliar with command-line tools can easily navigate and use the banking system.

### 3.2 Security

- Simulate basic security measures, such as account pin or password protections.

### 3.3 Modularity

- Structure the application into distinct modules for easier maintenance and potential future expansions.

### 3.4 Data Persistence

- Ensure that user data, account information, and transaction histories are safely stored and can be retrieved even after the system is closed or restarted.
