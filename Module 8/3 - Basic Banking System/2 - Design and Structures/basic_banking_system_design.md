# Module 8: Section 3.2 - Design Document for the Basic Banking System

---

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the design phase of the Basic Banking System! Before jumping into coding, it's essential to have a well-laid-out plan. This design document provides an in-depth breakdown of the system's architecture, components, data handling, and more. We'll touch upon every facet to ensure even the most novice developer feels prepared.

## 2. Key Terminologies

### 2.1 CLI (Command-Line Interface)

- **Description:** An interface that allows users to interact with software by typing commands rather than using a graphical interface. It's essential for our banking system to keep things lightweight and straightforward.

### 2.2 Data Persistence

- **Description:** The act of storing data in a manner that ensures its longevity, even after the system is terminated or restarted. This is crucial for a banking system where transaction histories and balances need to be maintained.

### 2.3 CRUD Operations

- **Description:** Refers to the four primary functions of persistent storage â€“ Create, Read, Update, Delete. These operations form the backbone of our system's interactions with data.

## 3. System Components & Design

### 3.1 Account Module

- **Purpose:** Manages all functionalities related to account operations.
  
- **Features:** 
    - Account creation with initial deposit and user details.
    - Account closure, ensuring prerequisites are met.
    - Account balance checking.

### 3.2 Transaction Module

- **Purpose:** Handle deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history.

- **Features:** 
    - Depositing funds into accounts.
    - Withdrawing funds with balance checks.
    - Viewing transaction history.

### 3.3 Data Storage Module

- **Purpose:** Ensures data persistence for the banking system.

- **Features:** 
    - Using SQLite for data storage.
    - CRUD operations for account and transaction data.

### 3.4 User Interface (CLI) Module

- **Purpose:** Provides an interactive interface for users.

- **Features:** 
    - Displaying menu options.
    - Accepting and processing user commands.
    - Displaying output and feedback.

## 4. Data Structures & Management

### 4.1 Account Data

- **Structure:** Each account can be represented as a **dictionary** with attributes like `account_number`, `name`, `balance`, and `password`.

### 4.2 Transaction Data

- **Structure:** Each transaction is also a **dictionary**, holding `account_number`, `transaction_type`, `amount`, and `date`.

### 4.3 SQLite Database

- **Purpose:** Offers a lightweight disk-based database, ensuring data persistence. It will store account and transaction data in separate tables.

## 5. Module Communication & Workflow

1. **User Interaction:** The user interacts with the CLI Module, entering commands and data.
  
2. **CLI & Modules:** Based on user input, the CLI module invokes functions in the Account or Transaction Modules.

3. **Data Storage:** The Account and Transaction Modules communicate with the Data Storage Module for CRUD operations.

4. **Feedback:** Post operation, feedback is returned to the CLI Module and displayed to the user.

## 6. Important Design Considerations

### 6.1 Data Security

- Even though we're simulating, it's crucial to understand real-world applications will require secure methods to store sensitive data, like hashing passwords.

### 6.2 Error Handling

- Errors should be captured and handled gracefully, offering feedback to the user and preventing system crashes.

### 6.3 Data Validation

- Before processing, data (e.g., deposit amounts, account numbers) needs validation to maintain data integrity and prevent potential issues.

## 7. Tips for New Developers

1. **Stay Modular:** Keeping components modular aids in troubleshooting specific parts without disrupting others.
  
2. **Thorough Testing:** Always test new functionalities in isolation before integrating them.

3. **Version Control:** Use tools like Git to maintain versions of your code, allowing easy rollbacks and collaboration.

4. **Seek Feedback:** Sharing your design or code with peers can offer fresh perspectives and catch overlooked errors.

## 8. Conclusion

Designing before diving into coding ensures a smoother development process. This document should serve as a blueprint as you embark on building the Basic Banking System. Remember, while it's essential to stick to the design, being adaptive to changes or new requirements is equally crucial.
