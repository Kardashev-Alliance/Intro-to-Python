## 4. Architecture

Structured modularly, the application ensures easy expansion and maintenance:

1. **CLI Module:** Manages user interactions, commands, and responses.
2. **Data Management Module:** Handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for contacts.
3. **Search Module:** Dedicated to contact search functionalities.
4. **Backup & Restore Module:** Manages contact data saving and loading processes.

## 5. Technologies & Tools

- **Language:** Python
- **Data Storage:** SQLite (For persistent data storage)
- **Version Control:** Git

---

## 6. Considerations

- **Data Security:** The user's contact data needs secure storage and protection from breaches.
- **Usability:** As a CLI tool, emphasis on clear prompts, instructions, and feedback to ensure user-friendliness.
- **Performance:** Efficiency is key, especially with potentially extensive contact lists.
