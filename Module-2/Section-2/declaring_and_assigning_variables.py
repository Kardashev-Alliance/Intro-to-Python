# Module 2: Variables in Python

# ========================================
# 2.2 Declaring and Assigning Variables
# ========================================

# ---- Syntax and Basics ----
# A variable is essentially a name pointing to a memory location that holds a value.
# Imagine labeling a box.

# Declare a variable named 'age' and assign a value of 30 to it.
age = 30

# Declare a variable named 'country' and assign the string 'US' to it.
country = "US"

# ---- Examples in Action ----
# Observe the above declarations for 'age' and 'country'.
# This helps the program remember and manipulate the values.

# ---- Multiple Assignments ----
# In Python, you can declare multiple variables and assign values to them in a single line.
# This is both efficient and readable.

x, y, z = "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"

# Here, 'x' will hold the value "Apple", 'y' will hold "Banana", and 'z' will have "Cherry".
# Think of it as labeling three boxes at once.
