# ========================================
# Module 2, Section 1.4: Naming Conventions
# ========================================

# -----------------------------
# The Pythonic Way: snake_case
# -----------------------------
# Variable names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores

user_name = "John Doe"
book_title = "Python Basics"

# This is more Pythonic than using camelCase or PascalCase for variable names
# e.g., userName or UserName would be less conventional in Python

# -----------------------------
# Avoiding Reserved Words
# -----------------------------
# It's important not to use Python's reserved words as variable names

# Incorrect: This will cause a syntax error
# if = 10 

# Instead, if you must refer to a word that's reserved, you can append an underscore:
if_ = 10

# -----------------------------
# Meaningful Variable Names
# -----------------------------
# Instead of vague names, use descriptive names

# Vague:
x = 50

# Descriptive:
student_count = 50

# -----------------------------
# Length of Variable Names
# -----------------------------
# Names should be descriptive but also reasonably concise

# Too long:
number_of_students_in_the_python_course = 30

# Just right:
python_student_count = 30

# The idea is to balance clarity with brevity
