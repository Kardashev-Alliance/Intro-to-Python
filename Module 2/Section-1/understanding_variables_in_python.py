# Module 2: Variables in Python

# ========================================
# 2.1 Introduction to Variables
# ========================================

# What is a variable?
# A variable is a container for storing data values.

name = "John"
score = 100

# Importance of variables in programming
# Variables allow for data reuse and manipulation in a program.

total_score = score + 50

# ========================================
# 2.2 Declaring and Assigning Variables
# ========================================

# Syntax and examples
age = 30
country = "US"

# Multiple assignments in a single line
x, y, z = "Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"

# ========================================
# 2.3 Types of Variables
# ========================================

# Introduction to data types
# Python has several built-in data types like str, int, list, etc.

data_type_of_name = type(name)  # This will return <class 'str'>

# Using type() to identify variable types
print(type(score))  # This will print <class 'int'>

# ========================================
# 2.4 Naming Conventions
# ========================================

# Pythonic way: snake_case for variable names
user_name = "Alice"
user_age = 25

# Reserved words and conflicts
# There are certain words like 'if', 'else', etc., which are reserved and shouldn't be used as variable names.

# Importance of meaningful variable names
# Good variable names make code more readable and maintainable.
